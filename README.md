## 💡 Tips for Standing Out

1. **Keep it Updated**: Add new projects as you complete them
2. **Show Your Code**: Link to GitHub repos when possible
3. **Quantify Impact**: Use metrics and numbers in project descriptions
4. **Professional Photo**: Add a high-quality headshot when ready
5. **Share Widely**: Add this URL to your resume, LinkedIn, and email signature

## 📊 What Makes This Portfolio Stand Out

✅ **Custom-Coded**: Shows you can actually build websites (not just use templates)  
✅ **GitHub Hosted**: Demonstrates knowledge of version control and deployment  
✅ **Project Depth**: Detailed case studies, not just project names  
✅ **Technical Range**: Shows full-stack skills from cloud to frontend to AI  
✅ **Professional Design**: Clean, modern aesthetic that looks polished  

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Site not showing up?**
- Wait 3-5 minutes after pushing files
- Check Settings → Pages to ensure it's enabled
- Make sure files are in the root directory, not a folder

**CSS not loading?**
- Check that all files are in the same directory
- Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Want to make changes?**
- Edit files directly on GitHub (click the file → Edit button)
- Or download, edit locally, and re-upload
