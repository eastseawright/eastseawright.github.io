            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Optima battery videos on YouTube have thousands of comments — real customers sharing 
                what they like, what they don't, and what they wish was different. But nobody at the 
                company was reading them in any organized way.
            </p>
            <p>
                I built a cloud-based system that automatically pulls in those comments, uses AI to 
                classify them as positive, negative, or neutral, and shows the trends in a dashboard 
                the marketing and product teams can actually use.

                            Built an Azure Function that connects to YouTube's API and automatically 
                            collects comments from Optima battery video playlists. The function organizes 
                            the raw comment data into a clean format for the next step.

                        <p>
                            Connected Azure's Language AI service to classify each comment as positive, 
                            neutral, negative, or mixed, with confidence scores. The AI also picks out 
                            specific topics people mention — like battery life, durability, or price — 
                            and how they feel about each one.

                            All the analyzed comments get stored in Cosmos DB, a cloud database that can 
                            handle growing volumes of data while keeping queries fast. As more comments come 
                            in over time, the system scales automatically.

                            Created dashboards that show sentiment trends over time, common topics in

                        Used Azure Functions so there's no server to manage. The system runs on a schedule

                        Cosmos DB handles the varied structure of YouTube comments naturally and automatically

                        Built the entire pipeline in Python — from pulling comments, to running AI analysis, 
                        to storing results. Includes error handling and logging so issues are easy to diagnose.

                manual comment reviews and gives the product and marketing teams a running view of 
                how customers feel about Optima batteries.
