            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a real-world WordPress website built entirely on AWS. The goal was to 
                create a fast, secure, and affordable site using cloud services — and to learn how 
                different AWS tools work together in a production setup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of traditional web hosting, I used AWS Lightsail for the server, Route 53 for 
                the domain, S3 for storing images and media, CloudFront for fast delivery worldwide, 
                and Certificate Manager for HTTPS security. The result is a professional website that's 
                secure, fast, and easy to maintain.

                        <p>
                            Created a Lightsail instance with WordPress pre-installed. Lightsail is AWS's 
                            simpler hosting option — it gives you a working server with predictable monthly 
                            pricing. Assigned a static IP address so the domain always points to the right place.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <strong>Why Lightsail:</strong> For a WordPress site, Lightsail offers the right 
                            balance of simplicity and control without the complexity of managing a full EC2 instance.

                            Registered the domain through Route 53 and set up DNS records to point the 
                            domain to the server. Created separate records for the main site (example.com), 
                            the www version, and a CDN subdomain for media delivery.

                            Logged into the WordPress admin panel, changed the default credentials for 
                            security, and configured the site to use the custom domain. Prepared the setup 
                            for the next steps: adding SSL and connecting cloud storage.

                        <h3>Add HTTPS Security</h3>
                        <p>
                            Got free SSL certificates through AWS Certificate Manager for the main domain, 
                            www subdomain, and CDN subdomain. AWS handles automatic renewal so the certificates 
                            never expire without manual intervention.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Why Multiple Certificates:</strong> Each subdomain needs its own certificate 
                            so that HTTPS works everywhere visitors might access the site or its media files.

                        <h3>Set Up Cloud Storage for Media</h3>
                        <p>
                            Created an S3 bucket to store images and media files separately from the web server. 
                            Set up a dedicated user account with the right permissions to upload files securely. 
                            Installed a WordPress plugin that automatically sends new uploads to S3 and can 
                            remove them from the server to save space.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            Added the AWS credentials to the WordPress configuration file so the site can 
                            communicate with S3 securely. Also set up permissions so CloudFront can read 
                            the files for delivery.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Keeping media files separate from the server 
                            means the server runs faster, storage scales automatically, and the site can grow 
                            without hitting capacity limits.
                        </p>

                    <div class="feature-content">
                        <h3>Add Global Content Delivery</h3>
                        <p>
                            Set up CloudFront to serve media files from servers around the world instead of 
                            the single origin server. Configured it to pull from the S3 bucket securely — the 
                            bucket itself stays private while CloudFront handles public delivery.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            Updated the WordPress plugin to use CloudFront URLs for all media files. This means 
                            when someone in Europe loads the site, their images come from a nearby server instead 
                            of traveling all the way back to the US.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <strong>Speed Impact:</strong> CloudFront caches content at locations worldwide, 
                            so visitors download images from servers close to them — making pages load 
                            noticeably faster for international visitors.

                    how they fit together.
