            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project demonstrates a production-ready WordPress deployment using AWS's suite of cloud 
                services. The architecture prioritizes security (HTTPS everywhere), performance (global CDN), 
                scalability (serverless compute and object storage), and cost efficiency (pay-as-you-go model).
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than using traditional server hosting, this implementation leverages AWS Lightsail for 
                simplified WordPress deployment, Route 53 for DNS management, CloudFront for global content 
                delivery, S3 for media storage, and Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS certificates. The result 
                is a fast, secure, and highly available website architecture.

                        <p>
                            Deployed WordPress using AWS Lightsail, which provides a simplified interface for 
                            serverless application deployment. Chose a Linux operating system with Bitnami's 
                            WordPress stack for optimized performance. Assigned a static IP address to the 
                            Lightsail instance to ensure consistent DNS resolution—critical for websites since 
                            dynamic IPs can change unexpectedly.

                            <strong>Technical Decision:</strong> Lightsail over EC2 provided the right balance 
                            of simplicity and control for this use case, with predictable pricing and integrated 
                            WordPress management through Bitnami.

                            Requested SSL certificate through AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for the domain. 
                            Created certificates for three domain variants: the root domain, www subdomain, 
                            and cdn subdomain. ACM provides free SSL/TLS certificates with automatic renewal, 
                            crucial for maintaining HTTPS without manual intervention.

                            <strong>Why Multiple Certificates:</strong> Each subdomain (www, cdn) needs its own 
                            certificate validation to enable HTTPS across all entry points to the site and CDN.

                        <h3>Storage Architecture: S3 Bucket & IAM Configuration</h3>
                        <p>
                            Created an S3 bucket for WordPress media storage to offload static files from the 
                            Lightsail instance. Configured an IAM user with programmatic access to AmazonS3FullAccess 
                            policy. Installed WP Offload Media plugin to automatically sync WordPress uploads to S3, 
                            with option to remove files from the server after upload to prevent storage bloat.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            Edited wp-config.php in the Bitnami WordPress directory to add AWS credentials 
                            (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) for the IAM user, enabling WordPress to 
                            authenticate with S3. Applied bucket policy to allow CloudFront to access objects 
                            for content delivery.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Architecture Benefit:</strong> Separating media storage from the application 
                            server improves performance, reduces server load, and provides scalable storage that 
                            can grow without affecting the Lightsail instance.

                        <h3>Content Delivery: CloudFront CDN Integration</h3>
                        <p>
                            Created a CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin. Configured an 
                            Origin Access Identity (OAI) to allow CloudFront to securely access S3 without making 
                            the bucket publicly accessible. Set the alternate domain name (CNAME) to the cdn 
                            subdomain configured in Route 53.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            Updated WP Offload Media plugin to use CloudFront as the delivery provider instead of 
                            direct S3 URLs. This ensures all media files are served through CloudFront's global edge 
                            network, dramatically reducing load times for international visitors and reducing bandwidth 
                            costs on the origin server.

                            <strong>Performance Impact:</strong> CloudFront caches content at edge locations worldwide, 
                            meaning users download images and media from servers geographically close to them rather 
                            than making requests all the way back to the origin S3 bucket.

                Successfully deployed a production-grade WordPress site with enterprise-level security, performance, 
                and scalability. The architecture demonstrates proficiency with multiple AWS services working together: 
                Lightsail provides simplified compute, Route 53 manages DNS, ACM secures communications with SSL/TLS, 
                S3 provides scalable storage, IAM controls access, and CloudFront delivers content globally.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                The implementation resulted in a fast, secure website with automatic HTTPS, globally distributed content 
                delivery reducing latency for international visitors, and separation of media storage from the application 
                server for better performance and scalability. The hands-on experience with this multi-service architecture 
                provided the practical knowledge that contributed to earning the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.
