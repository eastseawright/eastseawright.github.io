                An AI agent built with Microsoft Copilot Studio that helps customers instantly find 
                battery warranty and product information. Instead of searching through web pages for 5+ minutes,

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Customers visiting Clarios' Optima battery website had a hard time finding warranty information. 
                The process took 5+ minutes of clicking through pages, and most people ended up on a generic 
                contact page without an answer. That frustration was costing the company sales.
            </p>
            <p>
                I built an AI agent that gives customers specific warranty answers in about 20 seconds — 
                a 93% reduction in lookup time.

                    <h3>Too Many Clicks</h3>
                    <p>Finding warranty info took 5+ minutes of navigating through multiple pages, causing 
                    frustration and drop-off.</p>

                    never found.</p>

                            Made warranty information the agent's #1 priority since that's what customers 
                            were struggling to find. The bot helps users get exact warranty details for their 
                            specific product, which directly impacts purchase decisions.

                            instead of being sent to a generic contact page.

                            Uploaded warranty manuals and product guides to the bot's knowledge base. Used 
                            Google Analytics to find out what customers actually searched for most, then 
                            prioritized those topics so the bot could handle the most common questions first.

                The agent turned a frustrating 5-minute search into a 20-second conversation. Customers 
                now get specific warranty answers for their exact product instead of landing on a generic 
                contact page. This directly improved customer confidence and made it easier for people to 
                make purchase decisions.

            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <ul class="learning-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Watch Real Users First:</strong> Hotjar analytics showed customer needs that 
                    weren't obvious from product data alone. Real behavior should drive what the AI learns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Conversation Design Is Hard:</strong> Writing natural dialogue flows means 
                    anticipating dozens of edge cases and handling vague questions gracefully.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep Improving:</strong> The agent gets better with more data. I built 
                    tracking to catch failed queries and expand the knowledge base over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be Honest About Limits:</strong> Users trusted the bot more when it admitted 
                    it didn't know something and offered to connect them with a person.
