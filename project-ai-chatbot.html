            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Customers visiting Clarios' Optima battery website struggled to find warranty information and 
                battery specifications. The original user journey was 5+ minutes long with excessive clicks, 
                often ending at a generic contact page without answers. This friction impacted customer confidence, 
                ease of access, and ultimately sales.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed an AI-powered chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio that reduced the warranty 
                identification journey from 5 minutes to 20 seconds, providing instant, specific warranty 
                information based on users' exact needs.

                    <h3>Lengthy User Journey</h3>
                    <p>Finding warranty information required 5+ minutes of navigation through multiple pages, 
                    resulting in user frustration and drop-off.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <h3>Poor Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>Critical warranty details were buried deep in documentation, making it difficult for 
                    customers to verify coverage before purchase.</p>

                <div class="challenge-card">

                            Focused the chatbot's primary purpose on making battery and charger warranties easily 
                            accessible. The bot helps users find exact warranty information for specific products 
                            and use cases, prioritizing this critical information that directly impacts purchase 
                            decisions and customer confidence.

                            Customers can ask questions in plain English like "What's the warranty on the Optima 
                            RedTop?" and get instant, specific answers rather than generic contact information.

                            queries, ensuring the bot could answer the questions customers actually asked most

                The chatbot transformed the customer experience by reducing warranty identification time from 
                5+ minutes with excessive clicks to just 20 seconds with instant, specific answers. This 
                improvement directly enhanced customer confidence, increased sales conversion, and provided 
                better ease of access to critical product information. The bot outputs warranty information 
                tailored to users' specific needs rather than directing them to generic contact pages.

            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <ul class="learning-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>User Research is Critical:</strong> Hotjar analytics revealed customer needs that 
                    weren't obvious from product data alone. Real user behavior should drive AI training priorities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Conversation Design Complexity:</strong> Creating natural dialogue flows requires 
                    anticipating many edge cases and gracefully handling ambiguous queries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> LLM-based chatbots improve over time with more data. 
                    Built systems to monitor unsuccessful queries and expand the knowledge base accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Trust Through Transparency:</strong> Users appreciated when the bot acknowledged 
                    limitations and offered human handoff rather than providing uncertain answers.
