            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                At Clarios, there was no central place to view the 600+ applications supporting daily operations 
                across 7 global regions. Multiple applications were providing the same capabilities, and it was 
                difficult to identify application ownership and regional availability. With multiple business 
                and IT owners responsible for different applications, there was a clear need for better digital 
                organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I designed and developed a comprehensive Application Catalog using Microsoft Power Apps that 
                serves as the single source of truth for all enterprise applications across the organization, 
                placed at the front of the Global Application SharePoint Site.

                    complete picture of the IT landscape.</p>

            <p>
                I built a Power Apps canvas application integrated with SharePoint as the backend data source. 
                The application features:

                        <h3>Central Repository & Organization</h3>
                        <p>
                            All applications are organized by their functional purpose and capabilities. The 
                            catalog provides a central place where Clarios employees and contractors can find 
                            the right app for their needs, eliminating the confusion of multiple apps providing 
                            similar capabilities.

                        <p>
                            Implemented multi-level filtering allowing users to filter across Level 1 and Level 2 
                            business functionalities. Users can search by name, description, owner, region, and 
                            functional capabilities. The filtering logic handles complex Boolean operations and 
                            provides real-time results.

                The Application Catalog has become an essential tool for IT governance at Clarios, 
                enabling better decision-making around application investments, security compliance, 
                and license optimization. The centralized system has significantly reduced time spent 
                searching for application information and improved collaboration between global teams.
