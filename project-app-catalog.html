            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Clarios had no central place to view the 900+ applications used across 7 global regions. 
                Multiple apps were doing the same thing, and nobody had a clear picture of who owned what 
                or where it was available. Teams wasted time searching for the right tool or accidentally 
                building something that already existed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I designed and built an Application Catalog using Microsoft Power Apps that serves as the 
                single source for all business applications. It sits at the front of the Global 
                Application SharePoint site so anyone in the company can find what they need.

            <h2>Solution & Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                I built a Power Apps application connected to SharePoint as the data source. Here's what it does:
            </p>
            
            <div class="feature-list">
                <div class="feature-item">
                    <div class="feature-number">01</div>
                    <div class="feature-content">
                        <h3>One Place for Everything</h3>
                        <p>
                            All applications are organized by what they do. Employees and contractors can 
                            browse or search to find the right app for their needs, instead of guessing or 
                            asking around.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <h3>Flexible Search & Filtering</h3>
                        <p>
                            Users can filter by business function, region, owner, or keyword. The filters 
                            work together so you can narrow down results quickly — for example, finding all 
                            finance apps available in Europe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each application has its own page showing a description, what it's used for, 
                            where it's available (regional or global), and who the IT and business owners are. 
                            No more guessing who to contact about an app.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Direct Access & Requests</h3>
                        <p>
                            From the search results, users can launch an app directly, request access through 
                            the company's ticketing system, or view more details. This cuts out the back-and-forth 
                            of figuring out how to get started with a tool.

                The Application Catalog is now a go-to tool for IT governance at Clarios. It saves 
                employees time finding the right applications, helps leadership make better decisions 
                about software investments, and makes it easier for global teams to collaborate.
