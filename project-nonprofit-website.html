                Redesigned a submarine veterans organization's website as part of a four-person team.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Crash Dive Base is part of the United States Submarine Veterans Inc., a nonprofit 
                dedicated to honoring submarine service members and engaging the veteran community. 
                Their website needed updating to better serve their members and visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our four-person team (East, Ayomide, Connor, and Alex) through the UWM Nonprof-IT 
                program worked together to redesign the site — improving security, cleaning up 
                navigation, and making it easier for the veteran community to stay connected.

                    <h3>No Security Certificate</h3>
                    <p>The site didn't have SSL, so browsers showed it as "not secure" — not a good look 
                    for an organization asking people to trust them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <h3>Confusing Navigation</h3>
                    <p>The menu was disorganized, making it hard for veterans and visitors to find basic 
                    information about the organization.</p>

                    <h3>Outdated Backend</h3>
                    <p>The site was running an old version of PHP, which created security risks and blocked 
                    us from adding modern features.</p>

                    <p>The site needed to work for active veteran members, family members, and people 
                    learning about the organization for the first time.</p>

                            Redesigned the homepage to clearly communicate the organization's mission and 
                            put the most important information up front. Improved the visual layout to make 
                            a strong first impression for new visitors.

                            touch. Improved the contact form and made key contact information more visible.

                            and veteran resources. Grouped related pages together and reduced the number of 
                            clicks to reach important content.

                            Updated the site from an outdated PHP version to a modern one. This was a 
                            necessary first step before we could add the security certificate, and it also 
                            made the site load faster.

                            Added an SSL certificate so the site now uses HTTPS — encrypting visitor data, 
                            showing the padlock icon in browsers, and preventing attackers from creating 
                            fake versions of the site.

                        With the PHP update and SSL certificate, all visitor activity on the site is now 
                        encrypted. Browsers show the padlock icon, which builds trust with the community.

                    <p>
                        Refreshed the homepage and contact pages with a modern look that still respects 
                        the organization's military heritage and history.

                    <p>
                        The PHP update also improved page speed, making the site work better for everyone, 
                        especially visitors with slower internet connections.

                The updated site gives Crash Dive Base a modern, secure online presence that matches 
                the respect their mission deserves. The SSL certificate and PHP updates made the site 
                significantly more secure and faster, while the reorganized navigation helps veterans 
                and community members engage with the organization more easily.

                <li>
                    <strong>Security Basics Matter:</strong> Learned hands-on how SSL certificates work and 
                    why they depend on having updated backend software. Small security steps make a big 
                    difference in visitor trust.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Working with Non-Technical Clients:</strong> The veteran organization had specific 
                    needs and limited tech resources. I learned to explain technical concepts in plain language 
                    and focus on what mattered to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Navigation Design Matters More Than You Think:</strong> Reorganizing a menu sounds 
                    simple, but it dramatically changed how easy the site was to use. Site structure is a 
                    huge part of user experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Team Coordination:</strong> Worked with three teammates using Agile methods — 
                    dividing work, reviewing each other's contributions, and integrating everything into 
                    a cohesive final product.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Purpose-Driven Work:</strong> Building for a submarine veterans organization 
                    reinforced that technology serves real people and communities. This project directly 
                    supports veterans' ability to connect and honor their service.
