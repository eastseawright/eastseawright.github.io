            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Crash Dive Base, USSVI (United States Submarine Veterans Inc.) is a nonprofit organization 
                dedicated to perpetuating the memory of shipmates and engaging the community as veterans. 
                Their existing website, maintained by webmaster Manny Garmendez, needed modernization to 
                better serve the veteran community.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of the UWM Nonprof-IT program, our four-person team (East, Ayomide, Connor, and Alex) 
                worked collaboratively to redesign the website, focusing on improved navigation, enhanced 
                security, and better user experience for the submarine veteran community and their families.

                    <h3>Outdated Security</h3>
                    <p>The site lacked SSL certificate implementation, leaving user data vulnerable and 
                    affecting trustworthiness.</p>

                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <h3>Navigation Complexity</h3>
                    <p>The primary navigation menu was poorly organized, making it difficult for veterans 
                    and visitors to find key information.</p>

                            Completely redesigned the homepage to better communicate the organization's mission 
                            and make key information immediately accessible. Improved visual hierarchy to highlight 
                            the veteran community's purpose of perpetuating shipmate memory and community engagement.

                            Updated the site from legacy PHP to a modern version, which was a critical prerequisite 
                            for implementing SSL certificates. This update improved site performance, security, and 
                            enabled modern security features to protect user data.

                        <p>
                            Implemented SSL/TLS certificate to enable HTTPS, keeping user data secure and verifying 
                            website ownership. This prevents attackers from creating fake versions of the site and 
                            provides visual trust indicators (padlock icon) to visitors. The SSL certificate ensures 
                            encrypted communication between users and the site.

                        and visitors can now find membership information, event details, and community resources

                The redesigned website successfully modernized Crash Dive Base's digital presence while 
                honoring the organization's mission. The implementation of SSL certificates and PHP updates 
                dramatically improved security and site performance. The reorganized navigation makes it 
                easier for veterans and community members to engage with the organization, supporting their 
                mission to perpetuate the memory of submarine service members.

                <li>
                    <strong>Security Implementation:</strong> Gained hands-on experience implementing SSL/TLS 
                    certificates and understanding the relationship between PHP versions and security features. 
                    Learned why HTTPS is critical for user trust and data protection.

                <li>
                    <strong>Nonprofit Client Work:</strong> Worked with a veteran organization with specific 
                    needs and limited technical resources. Learned to communicate technical concepts to 
                    non-technical stakeholders effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Information Architecture:</strong> Reorganizing navigation taught us how critical 
                    site structure is to user experience. Small changes in menu organization can dramatically 
                    improve usability.
