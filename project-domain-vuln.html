            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Clarios operates domains across global operations, each supporting critical business functions 
                from marketing sites to customer portals. However, many of these domains had accumulated security 
                vulnerabilities over time, creating potential risks for customer trust, regulatory compliance, 
                and overall security posture.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was tasked with identifying and remediating these vulnerabilities, working directly with 
                domain owners across different regions and departments to implement security fixes and improve 
                Clarios' BitSight security score.

                        <p>
                            Used BitSight security monitoring platform to analyze reports and identify 
                            vulnerabilities across Clarios' domain portfolio. Focused on high-impact issues 
                            affecting company security, prioritizing based on severity and potential business 
                            impact. Created a comprehensive inventory of vulnerable domains requiring remediation.

                        <p>
                            Developed Excel formulas to efficiently cross-reference vulnerable domains identified 
                            by BitSight against our internal domain ownership list. This streamlined the process 
                            of identifying actionable domains with established contacts and likely owners, making 
                            the remediation process much more efficient than manual lookup.

                        Many vulnerable domains were legacy sites with unclear ownership or outdated technology 
                        stacks. Required detective work to identify current maintainers and assess whether sites

                Successfully remediated vulnerabilities across 10+ domains, significantly improving Clarios' 
                overall security posture. Consolidated domain infrastructure by redirecting legacy sites and 
                decommissioning inactive ones, reducing attack surface. The improved security across Clarios' 
                digital infrastructure resulted in better customer trust, enhanced regulatory compliance, and 
                a measurably improved BitSight security score.

            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <ul class="learning-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Security Requires Collaboration:</strong> Technical vulnerabilities can't be fixed 
                    in isolation. Success required building relationships with domain owners, understanding their 
                    constraints, and providing practical support.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clear Communication is Critical:</strong> Translating security vulnerabilities into 
                    business impact helped stakeholders understand urgency and prioritize fixes appropriately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data-Driven Efficiency:</strong> Using Excel to cross-reference domains saved 
                    significant time compared to manual lookup, demonstrating how simple automation can multiply 
                    effectiveness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Infrastructure Hygiene:</strong> Many vulnerabilities stemmed from legacy sites that 
                    should have been decommissioned. Regular infrastructure audits prevent security debt accumulation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Real-World Security:</strong> Gained practical experience with security monitoring 
                    tools, SSL/TLS management, and how theoretical vulnerabilities manifest in production environments.
