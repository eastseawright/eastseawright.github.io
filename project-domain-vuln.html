            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Clarios has websites across the globe supporting everything from marketing to customer portals. 
                Over time, many of these sites had developed security issues — expired certificates, missing 
                security settings, outdated configurations — that put customer trust and compliance at risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was responsible for identifying these issues, tracking down the right people to fix them, 
                and following up until the fixes were verified. The result was a measurably improved 
                company security score.

                    <h3>Missing Security Headers</h3>
                    <p>Many sites were missing basic security settings that protect against common web attacks.</p>

                            Used BitSight, a security monitoring platform, to scan Clarios' domains and 
                            identify vulnerabilities. Prioritized issues by severity and business impact, 
                            creating a clear list of what needed to be fixed first.

                            ownership records. This turned a manual lookup process into something that could 
                            be done in minutes instead of hours.

                    <p>
                        Many vulnerable domains were legacy sites that nobody clearly owned anymore. 
                        Required detective work to find the right contacts and decide whether to fix 
                        or shut down each site.

                        With domain owners spread across the globe, I had to write clear, self-contained

                Fixed security issues across 10+ domains, improving Clarios' overall security posture. 
                Consolidated the domain landscape by redirecting legacy sites and shutting down inactive 
                ones, reducing the number of potential attack points. The work resulted in a measurably 
                improved BitSight security score and better compliance standing.

            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>

                <li>
                    <strong>Security Is a Team Sport:</strong> Fixing vulnerabilities requires building 
                    relationships with domain owners, understanding their priorities, and giving them 
                    practical support.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Speak the Business Language:</strong> Explaining security issues in terms of 
                    business risk helped stakeholders understand urgency and act faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Simple Automation Saves Hours:</strong> Using Excel formulas to cross-reference 
                    domain lists saved significant time compared to manual lookups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clean Up Old Sites:</strong> Many issues came from legacy sites that should have 
                    been shut down. Regular cleanup prevents security problems from piling up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hands-On Security Experience:</strong> Gained practical experience with security 
                    monitoring tools, SSL certificate management, and how security vulnerabilities play out 
                    in real production environments.
